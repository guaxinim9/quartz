Welcome to my digital garden! Here I will post notes and essays that I think others might find useful or interesting, along with uploading things I really like, such as [[Sadhana the Realization of Life]]. 

Some of my recent writings:
 - [[Education of the Future]]
 - [[The Testimony of Others]]
 - [[Universal brotherhood is no substitute for brotherhood]]
 - [[Telling "The Adults" to "Do Something"]]
 - [[Grim Galactic Civilization]]
 - [[Be the change you wish to see]]
