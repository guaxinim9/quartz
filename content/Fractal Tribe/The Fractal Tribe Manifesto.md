### Human Nature

We are meant to live together. We evolved in tribes. So our basic cognitive architecture is optimized for the tribe. It is [[Human Nature]].

I came upon this way of thinking scientifically, through the doctrine of evolutionary psychology. But religion says the same thing. The early Christians organized themselves into small communities. We are used to thinking of commune-building as the doomed enterprise of idealists, and to some extent this is true - most communes fail. But religious communes are an obvious and shining exception. They have always functioned and flourished, and continue to do so to this day. Surrendering one's will to Christ would seem an absurdly irrational move, but the proof is in the proverbial pudding. 

God wants us to live in tribes, and nature wants the same. No matter your metaphor, we are meant to live together.



But, we don't. We are [[lonely]]. We live as individuals. If we're lucky, we make families which 

So, how can we make this happen today?



Living things enjoy a unity of purpose. There is no separation between body and mind. Both are instruments of the same. 

Every form evolves to fulfill a function. The tiger pounces, the deer flees, the flea sucks, the spider weaves — all live as seamless extensions of their environment, bound by their relations to each other and the conditions of the incarnation. We are no different. We have a place within the order of things.

Now, we have clearly blown up into something unlike other animals. We can survive in any ecosystem and subsist on almost anything. We can eke out a meager existence on crickets and tree sap, or drown in abundance and titillate ourselves with thousand-layer pastries and exotic shellfish. The nature of the game may be entirely different from one culture to another. But there is one commonality across all human cultures, and it is in this that our evolutionary legacy may be said to consist. 

We are social animals. We are optimized for life in small, committed groups, where everyone knows everyone, and a strong community spirit is the bedrock of all activity. Let us call this the Tribe. 

Just as lions live in prides and bees in hives, humans evolved to live in tribes. If modern man is homeless, confused, adrift, with no way of being in the world, we may consider the possibility that this is for lack of a tribe, which is the natural intermediary between the individual and the incomprehensible. We are not made to live as individuals. It is very scary for us, and the strategies we adopt to cope are often self-destructive.

Healthy dolphins separated from their pods are known to die of loneliness. Human beings are killing themselves every day. Tribal cultures do not know depression or suicide. Why? Because they live as humans are meant to live. We are [[built for the tribe]].

Everyone knows that we need community. Science and religion are in complete agreement. Everyone knows that we lack community. With the advent of AI and the internet, our civilization has the opportunity to redesign its basic social architecture, on a scale unforeseen since the advent of the alphabet. 

Our evolutionary legacy may hold some inspiration, in this adventure of cultural redesign. We _know_ that human beings are happy in tribes, moving with the rhythm of things. We know that suicide is unheard of and cancer extremely rare, among people living in a human way. How many billions does our society pour into mental health and cancer research? Could the solution be as simple as living with others, and doing real work together?

Let us become as tribes again. Gather our people. Pool our resources. Let us get together, commit to each other, and forge a life as one.

### The Tribe

To be is to give. To receive is to reify the other’s being. We become ourselves only through the other. 

In the tribe, everybody knows everybody. Robin Dunbar has suggested that the human brain has a structural limit on the number of close social relationships which can be maintained. His guess of 150, give or take, is known as Dunbar’s number. The idea is that our brains are built for communities of about this size. Any larger, and you can’t know everyone. You can know their names, you can know some facts about them, but you can’t truly know who they are and how you all relate to one another. There’s just not enough space in your head. Deep camaraderie with another is complex. Lot of moving parts.

Some people seem to have a sort of innate diplomatic archetype, and they can live and move confidently in networks far larger than 150. For example, a high school of 1500. There are always a few social butterflies that seem to know everyone. But then — there’s the rub! — you all graduate, and all of those people that you spent time and energy getting to know are no longer relevant. You may hang on to a few friendships, but most of the data you accumulated will be pretty well useless. Everyone goes their separate ways. 

How many times does this happen, in a lifetime, in civilization? How many times do you learn the rhythms of some social ecosystem — elementary school, high school, university dorm, job, etc — only to leave? How many times do you get to know another person, only to drift apart? And then you’ve gotta introduce yourself to another stranger. 

> so we live, always saying goodbye. — Rilke

This constant coming and going takes a toll. It’s inefficient. Truly getting to know someone takes a lot of time and energy. Amidst this flux, you may lose your drive to connect altogether. 

Suppose instead you were committed to live, work, and play with the same group of people. For life. Imagine how well you would get to know them! The mutual trust you would build!

Imagine the peace of being surrounded and supported by a group of people who are in it with you, the endeavour of life, who know you in the fullness of your personality and spirit, your quirks and your genius, your flaws which can never become tragic or self-destructive for they are balanced by the love and grace of the whole, and they love you, warts and all, and all, and all. You are loved, you are seen, you are appreciated for what you bring. You can count on your tribe.

And the anxiety of not having this, not in its fullness, of having it in fragments, and always subject to conditions. The individual lives in fear, because the individual is built for the tribe, and has been forced to fend for themselves.

I found myself at [[Christianity|Christian]] church one Sunday and the guy was talking about the notion of being _fully known_ and _fully loved_ by God. He reckons only God can fully know and fully love you. He has never felt it from anywhere else. ‘To be fully known, and fully loved,’ he said, ‘I think that is how I would define the kingdom of Heaven.’ And of course it is the tribe.

### The Individual

Unbound by tradition or responsibility, the individual is free to choose his own path, and tell his own story.

This is how I will define the individual: one who is at the centre of their own story. One would be forgiven for thinking this is the case for all beings, that to be a thing at all is to be a ‘narrative centre of gravity,’ in the late Dennett’s phrase. In fact, a tree’s life story has far more to do with the forest as a whole. All of the major events — fire, rain, drought, storm, loggers — are shared with the larger body. Likewise a tribal human being is likely to tell their life story in terms of the tribe. A hard winter, a great party, a bloody skirmish, a migration across vast and unpredictable terrain. The events that are exclusive to the individual will be few and far between: a spiritual revelation here, a grisly injury there; and even they will be told in relation to the tribe: we are given visions to share with others, to better serve them; when we are sick or wounded, others take care of us. Fortunes good and bad are shared.

In the life of the individual, the self is the only constant. The individual is responsible for himself. His fortunes are his own. His story is about him moving in the world, alone.

Didion said we tell ourselves stories in order to live. This belies the essence of the individual. We tell ourselves stories about ourselves; in this our being consists. 

In the tribe stories are handed down, and shared. We tell each other stories in order to live. Stories are the connective tissue of culture and they are not doing their job in one solitary head. 

Certain modern thinkers have rightly declared this kind of life meaningless, but most have erroneously believed themselves to be making a metaphysical statement. They sloppily couple their lonely dissatisfaction with banal observations about the size of the stars, and call it a worldview. But it has nothing do with metaphysics. It is simply the complaint of the human body: I do not touch the other enough; and of the human mind: I can give nothing of mine. Meaning is a relational thing. The world is made of meaning, but the self-referential individual can have no dialogue with it.

The individual every once in a while is a rock star or CEO, and this sort of person is who we normally think of when we think of the individual. But most of the time the individual is cheap labour and an addict.

If man is built for the tribe, he is weak alone. His body knows it. No matter his station, he never feels safe; atop the highest tower he still senses threat and scarcity. Risk-averse and fearful, his decisions will be irrational.

With a tribe, you can overcome and navigate through anything. With a tribe, you are the most powerful and adaptable thing nature has yet created. With a tribe, you are safe. Not invincible, but you are safe. You are safe to be, safe to experiment and express, safe to take risks.

Your body knows that without a tribe, you’re dead meat. A small minority of flamboyant individuals turn their tribeless lives into blazes of glory. But the rest get the memo that, by all rights, they’re dead meat, and act like it.

Fending for yourself in this mess is exhausting and it makes a cornered animal of you. Spending all of your energy on reaction, you are at the whim of your environment, and easily manipulated by malevolent interests. You are no good alone.

### Loneliness

> We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community. — Dorothy Day

The US Surgeon General has issued an advisory warning of the dangers of loneliness and extolling the benefits of community. According to the good doctor, social isolation is more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, more dangerous still than alcoholism, obesity, inactivity, and pollution.

Between 2003 and 2020, in the United States, time spent with friends declined an average of 20 hours a month, deep companionship declined 14 hours a month, household family engagement declined 5 hours a month. ‘Social isolation’ increased 24 hours a month. In 2018, only 16% of Americans said that they felt very attached to their local community, and this was all before Covid.

The Surgeon General calls us to action. Let’s get together, guys! ‘Each of us can start now, in our own lives, by strengthening our connections and relationships.’

This is all well and good, and kudos to the doc for taking a stand. But if humans have a fundamental need to belong and connect, it is strange that we should need a public health official to talk us into it. We are social animals. We need each other. In the cities, there are millions of people, and all are built to connect. So what gives? Why is there no community?

There must be something in the woodwork. We all seek each other. If we are disconnected, it cannot be for lack of trying. A man dying of thirst cannot simply be told to drink — if he had water, he wouldn’t be dying.

There must be something deeper separating us than mere laziness — perhaps something in the very architecture of our culture. I submit that this something is none other than the form of the individual, his particular way of being — which has shaped the physical architecture of our towns and cities.

Civilization as we know it is made of individuals moving in the world. Our institutions create an artificial coherence. But life is a fractal thing, as above so below, and it is the individual and the life of the individual and the psyche of the individual that gives our civilization its particular character.

We are so used to the mode of the individual that we assume it in all of our economic models. The reason why ‘progress’ has hit such a bottleneck is that we cannot imagine an economic system with anything other than individuals as its building blocks. And this is precisely the threshold which we must cross.

### Commitment

Humans evolved to live in tribes, and we are happy in tribes. Herons evolved to hunt at low tide, and they are happy by the seaside.

Now, we are not herons. We are more adaptable by far, and can find flourishing in almost any circumstances–as long as we are with others.

In civilization today, we are with others all the time, but we are not _with_ others. We are not in it together with them, moving through the world as one unified body. We are moving through the world alone; almost all of our relationships are provisional — for right now. The essence of the archetype of the tribe is commitment to others. This can take almost any form, as long as everyone in the tribe knows everyone, and nobody is going anywhere. True commitment is a necessary prerequisite for building community.

We think that freedom and commitment are opposites, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Freedom is to commitment as a blank canvas is to a masterpiece. The latter is the highest realization of the former. Freedom affirms itself as freedom when it is used to choose — in the instant, for ever. 

Let us discuss marriage. If you truly love another person, you take yourself off the market. You stop searching. You stop yearning. You redirect your focus away from the ingrained habit of restless desire. Depending on your disposition and the extent of your sickness, it may take some time before the infinite possibility of beautiful strangers truly fails to stir you. But it is bound to happen, because you are not built for this flux. 

Likewise once you find your tribe, you must take yourself off the market of possible lives, possible faraway belonging and fulfillment. You must accept the life and the love which God has given you. You must get stuck in! Give your all to your people! Cultivate this garden with all your might! You will find the strength of your will grow as the garden does — whereas alone in the pleasure dome, nothing grows, nothing is truly given or received, and your life force will atrophy, and you will tire of yourself.

Commitment is the only antidote to the market’s infinity of choice. Marriage is commitment to love, and the tribe is commitment to community.

The tribe means togetherness, unity of purpose. The tribe means sharing this life. The tribe means cooperation and cohabitation with the same consistent group over the course of a lifetime. Naturally you are bound to evolve together towards an evermore perfect union. But not if all the other lives you could be living are still on the table. The tribe means being all in.

If you fail to choose decisively, to commit your entire being, if you stay trapped in the game at large, falling in love with strangers and pictures of faraway lands — then what you have will remain merely one of many options. And what you have — your tribe, your wife, your life — will be known and banal, its faults and small dysfunctions constantly present. If you never choose this particular branch of the tree with everything you got, eventually the fantasy of the infinite will overpower your lazy comfort and force of habit, which is no substitute for true commitment.

And what can perfect strangers or exotic idylls really give you? They will become banal in their turn. Meanwhile you will grow old adrift, a trillion figs rotting at your feet.

The infinite is no place to make a life. The individual ages poorly.

Therefore, choose with gusto!

### Security

Civilization cannot meet our needs. It can feed us and keep us warm, some of us, for now, though famously this isn’t sustainable. We are consuming the world’s energy faster and faster, heedless of universal law, and eventually our whole great machine will cease to function; it will collapse under its own weight. Civilization as we know it is inevitably doomed. There will be a day when this is undeniable, and there will be billions of people alive on that day and the days which follow it. What will become of them? A whole generation of children will not be sat in school and tranquilized by their devices and fed by the grocery store and heated and watered and materially taken care of and bored to shreds. The half-life we take for granted will no longer be on the table; the glass drains even now. A couple months ago grocery stores where I live had a sugar shortage. A sugar shortage! My social contract promised infinite sugar! It’s the bare fucking minimum! What could be a clearer canary in the coal mine than a drought of cheap and hyper-refined pleasure! Temporary, this time. But the droughts will get longer and harsher. I tell you it is a mathematical fact that one day there will be no more in the tank; the amenities will all be out of order. They will go out of order and we will be frightened, and the men on top will pull a week of sleepless nights and wrestle them back, with no concern for the long run. They will wrestle them back at all costs so we can go on chugging for a little while longer, and their short-term strategy will of course make the situation even worse and less workable and the power will go out again soon, and again they will wrestle it back in even more destructive fashion, but what else are they to do, they can’t just let it collapse, the end of the world is an event of infinite disutility, it is therefore worth postponing at all costs. This at any rate is the essence of their calculus. And so they will keep hitting the snooze button, though it takes more and more energy to do so each time. And the power will keep going out more and more frequently and it will take more and more energy to wrestle it back and it will take a superhuman and heroic effort the last few times but they will do it, they will find the energy within themselves, out of love, because they do love their children, and want them to be warm and safe, and everything is insignificant compared. But and mark my words there will come a day when all the power goes out and there is no way to get it back, it is simply gone, and there is no wifi, water, electricity, heat, no gas for trans-continental trucks and planes and great freighters to ferry all the goods around. This will inevitably happen on our current course, sooner or later. It is the iceberg in our sights, a fact, implacable.

You think you’re playing it safe, but there is no such thing. There is nothing so dangerous as safety. Today’s empty safety sows the seeds of tomorrow’s mortal peril. You don’t even know how to make a fire, let alone a decent hut; all of your eggs are in the supermarket’s basket. What happens when the supermarket is out of eggs?

Individuals often feel that their world is vaguely unreal and they are just floating through getting by. The collapse will do away with this illusion for good. Everything here is unbearably real. Everything that happens is exactly what happens. Your food comes from somewhere. Your waste goes somewhere. God’s books are balanced. Everyone here is going to die, and first they are going to do their best, and the world is very large, and everything that happens really happens, you may be torn limb from limb, you may starve on the streets, you may go crazy, get bent, and die die die. There is no escape; there will be an outcome. Something will become of you.

For now, the systems provide. But the flood looms. It will not be kind to the individual.

Unlike the individual, the tribe will be well poised to meet the collapse head-on, having already made self-sufficiency its business. Tribes can adapt to any conditions. In all possible futures, those who have done the work of reconnecting with what it means to be human — with land, with God, and with each other — will be in the strongest position. And whatever happens in the future, we know for a fact that something’s gotta give. The world will change. It’s going to be a trip.

It is not merely idealistic but also perfectly pragmatic to commit yourself to the tribe. To put your faith in others.

### Efficiency

It is not merely idealistic but also objectively efficient to reorganize society along these lines. To build a civilization of tribes, rather than individuals.

Our economic model holds that the rational individual will act in the market according to their own best interests. Through this vast and endless negotiation, somehow everything gets done. We believe in the market as the imperfect but organic expression of all human intention. Everyone is doing what they can with what they’ve got. There is a great beauty and optimism in this vision.

But let us take a clear eyed look at the situation on the ground.

When we are without a tribe to take care of us, we know in our guts that we are in danger, likely to die alone on the unforgiving open plain. 

Individuals tend therefore to be weak and desperate, living in survival mode, making decisions for the short term. They need bread now, their children need bread, and so they sell themselves. They have no choice.

This system does not create self-actualized human beings, capable of being rational actors in the ever-expanding global market. It creates cheap labour.

The animal fear of the individual precludes the possibility of rational choice. Only humans who _have_ a choice are capable in principle of making a rational choice. The assumptions of our economics are therefore bunk as long as billions must choose between slavery and starvation.

Let us consider the effect on people’s habits when they feel safe, secure, and stable. They first and foremost consume much less crap. Those living paycheque to paycheque, barely getting by, will be much more likely to buy a $30 sweater made from dirt-cheap synthetic fabrics by a child, than a $200 sweater made from wool by an artisan, even if the latter sweater will last ten times longer and is therefore objectively more cost-effective, besides being a better sweater, likely more comfortable, more stylish, will feel better to wear, all before even touching matters of ethics. It is even more efficient from the perspective of society. Ten cheap sweaters in the landfill multiplied by all of the people just getting by making obviously inefficient purchases, and all of the other crap they’re buying and throwing out besides sweaters. This system does not serve the people. It does not even serve itself. It serves whoever can make the cheapest sweater. And that is whoever is willing to stoop the lowest, employ the youngest Bangladeshi child, treat them the poorest, feed them the cheapest excuse for food — which in turn is produced by the man willing to rape and poison the land most expeditiously. In short, the system belongs to the least scrupulous. Those willing and able, through a combination of childhood trauma and sociopathic disposition and abundant incentive, to root out each and every remnant of their humanity. These men are the deepest roots of all of our markets; trace any supply chain to its origin and you will find one of them. They are the rocks upon which our church is built.

Is it not obvious that those Bangladeshi children are enslaved? Well, we don’t like that _word_ anymore, so we toss them a little copper, and we feel alright. But they are of course absolutely dehumanized and have no choice in the matter; they would not endure this if they had other options. 

If they had grown up in tribes, or even traditional villages, they would not deign to work in the sweater sweatshop. No shot. They would have a sense of their intrinsic value, confidence in their abilities to hunt or gather or grow food, and faith in the world to provide for their needs. They would certainly refuse to chain themselves to the machine. And the exact same principle applies in the first world. Nobody would choose to work on the assembly line but for the animal desperation of the isolated. Nobody who truly felt safe and free would choose to be a cashier or insurance agent or telemarketer. To be isolated is to be disempowered. Nobody is responsible for you but you. You are fending for yourself in a world which you cannot make sense of. You don’t have much of a choice. You can find a job and show up, or head to skid row. 

Writes the economist E.F. Schumacher:

> That soul-destroying, meaningless, mechanical, monotonous, moronic work is an insult to human nature which must necessarily and inevitably produce either escapism or aggression, and that no amount of “bread and circuses” can compensate for the damage done — these are facts which are neither denied nor acknowledged but are met with an unbreakable conspiracy of silence — because to deny them would be too obviously absurd and to acknowledge them would condemn the central preoccupation of modern society as a crime against humanity.

Even if free markets are truly the highest possible expression of human will and value, surely these markets are stronger if they are made up of strong tribes and not impotent individuals making decisions out of desperation. Exploitation is simply inefficient. It’s the addict’s mindset in macro— burning human potential for a short-term kick. It is suicidal behaviour on the scale of culture. 

Only people whose basic needs are met unconditionally will fulfill the assumptions of our economic model. Existing in a felt relationship to the business of survival, they will know what they need, and what it takes to make it happen. They will only take on a job that is truly challenging and interesting, since they can always just work for the tribe — farming, building, caring, entertaining.

This is real human labour, directly productive and genuinely fulfilling. Tribes can take care of themselves; with that baseline, they are strong. Humans in tribes know who they are, what they need, what they’re capable of, how they relate to the world. They are the rational economic agents we have heard so much about.

These humans — and they truly deserve the name — feel free to be themselves, to become themselves. And this turns out to be the greatest efficiency of all. 

### Potential

A society’s true object is the realization of human potential. The strength of a social model consists solely in how much of its people’s potential it is capable of realizing. 

The tribe is built and optimized to facilitate the growth of its members — after all, it is its members. It can’t get away with leaving their potential untapped. If a tribe has 100 people, and 1 does not fully become themselves, does not develop their own innate genius, the tribe is 1 percent weaker. That could make the difference between surviving the winter and oblivion. Over time, evolution dictates that it will make the difference. The cultural traditions which do not foster the full greatness of their members do not last. The cultures which survive are perfectly sculpted channels of human excellence. Our global monoculture is destined for the dustbin of history as long as it leaves infinite potential on the table.

A musical genius may play and inspire the tribe to greater efforts, more perfect union. If their potential is left untapped the tribe is weaker. The boost of motivation they provide may have made the difference in crucial moments. A hunt may fail; frail children, themselves full of great potential, may not survive the winter. The bigger a baby’s brain, the more useless it is, the more energy it takes to keep it alive. But if the tribe is strong enough to support that dead weight, the big-brained child, once it grows into a contributing human, may have an extraordinary potential to realize, and make the tribe even stronger. Perhaps their ingenuity will devise a new and efficient method of trapping rabbits, increasing the tribe’s net food yield for generations to come. There is a clear compounding effect to the comfortable abundance which fosters nurturing and patient cultures. The cultures which cannot provide a safe and affirming container for their people to grow up, experiment, take their time — these cultures are outcompeted, and fail in a hurry. There are ripple effects to underutilizing any given human. Though these are disguised in civilization, they are still present. How many geniuses and potential geniuses were annihilated in the Holocaust? And how many Germans’ higher potentials had to be suppressed in order for it to come to this? How many of their glorious sons died in the first world war, or wasted away in factories? How many of their glorious daughters lost the fire of life in the prescribed mundanity of the housewife? This is a pressure cooker waiting to explode — it was bound to happen sooner or later. 

And how does our own society measure up? Are we so different? Is that same repressed force not curdling now underneath our own national dream? How many potential leaders and inventors never get a shot, numb themselves with alcohol, and end up abusing their kids, who are in turn stunted? We may ignore this problem, placate the underutilized with consumer goods, but the restless energy of their creative repression does not go away. We do pay all of our costs one way or another.

A genius must be given the chance to play. If they are left to languish on the factory floor, humanity is short a genius. And this has consequences.

So the tribe is not only idealistic but also efficient. Human potential is by all accounts an extraordinarily potent resource. A society pays a massive opportunity cost when relegating even one person to a life of repetitive, mind-numbing labour. Getting the best out of people is the name of the game.

Despite our obsession with value and optimization, we seem not to take this most fundamental of challenges very seriously. We put our children through a one-size-fits-all school system which verifiably fits no one. They sit and listen to stuff they mostly don’t care about, they complete assignments, occasionally they get to play a game. This is so demoralizing as to alienate them from the higher potentials latent within. Then they are thrown headlong into the vast matrix of selfish interests, to fend for themselves as individuals. The loneliness of this mode makes people sick and tired and ineffective, and it makes them unsure of themselves and their place in the world. We have shown how the individual’s place in the world is precisely within the tribe. Even the most unusual, willful, individualist individual will only reach his true flourishing when he is in his proper place, among his tribe. Napoleon, for instance, did not reach his true flourishing — he got drunk on grandeur and died alone. His talents could have been better utilized.

Without a tribe, people rightly feel that they have no place in the world, and so they lose faith in themselves; they have no reason to believe they are worthy. This alone is what permits demeaning, robotic jobs to exist. People do not have self-worth, self-belief, or self-knowledge. Only alone will we accept the assembly line, the coal mine, the cubicle. And these sorts of lives consign their occupants to oblivion. Their potential dies; a liability, it has nowhere to go. If your place in the world is putting the same sticker on the same plastic cylinder over and over and over again every day, then anything beyond that is superfluous. There is no reason for you to become human. The optimal adaptation to life on the assembly line is to kill your higher self and resign yourself completely.

But you do have the seeds of greatness within you. So this is not only a tragedy but also, on the scale of society, woefully inefficient.

The unfolding of the human story is accelerating. There are more prophets, visionaries, and innovators alive today than at any other time in history. We should cultivate the soil that they might bloom.

### Revolution

Civilization is unbecoming. We cut down the trees. We fill the ocean with trash. We rape our mother. We make ourselves weak and miserable. Meanwhile we contain ourselves.

It’s old news. You know the score. But what to do? We could all rise up and destroy the existing order, but we know that goes nowhere. It’s as if some fine print hidden in the laws of physics says we’ll just get an even meaner guy atop an even bigger mess. We could work within the system to gradually reform it, but man, guys have tried, and we know where that one goes, too. You make infinite compromises to even get far enough in the game to stand a chance, and if you keep your focus and hang on to yourself in spite of everything, you just might be able to nudge the needle a couple millimetres over, only for the inevitable reaction to lash things back to how they were, if not further. Again some law of dynamics seems to be at play here. The house always wins.

The house wins because it is the house. By ascending its ladder you accept its logic. You agree to move within it according to its terms. Perhaps if you make it to the top you can fiddle with the levers, but you cannot subvert the fundamental nature of the beast. Plus, on top of everything, things blur together. Your engagement with them must be generalized and abstracted. You must deal in big data and broad trends. You lose sight of the details, and the details are human beings.

Saving humanity cannot be a top-down business. It won’t happen in one fell swoop. This is the individual’s dream of perfect heroism: saving the world as unquestioned and universally acknowledged main character. To be the hero: above all. This angle only affirms civilization, which, after all, is a particular strain of male self-centredness.

So no revolution, and no electoral politics. There is a reason why nobody believes in revolution anymore. The system cannot be changed from within, and it cannot be destroyed from without, at least not to anyone’s benefit. We must build first.

> “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” — Buckminster Fuller

The 20th century’s revolutionary communist masses rose up in the name of an abstract idea to destroy the old order. It was assumed that building something better would be a relatively trivial task to be worried about later, since everyone meant well and generally had the right idea and intended to do their best.

On taking power in Cambodia the Khmer Rouge declared that it was now ‘Year Zero.’ This meant the total annihilation and forgetting of everything that came before. They cleared out the cities and abolished money. They forced everyone into agrarian communities. They killed everyone who embodied any of the old cultural ideals: all the lawyers, teachers, financiers, writers, doctors, industrialists, engineers, and clergy. Then they fizzled. The regime lasted 4 years. All these utopian ideals, and all they ever did was kill guys! I mean, all these communist revolutions, they came from anger, that was their spiritual impetus, the anger of the male ego, and they focused all of their energy on society’s badness, and they were totally without God or gratitude. And so of course all they ever did was kill guys, since systems like capitalism and imperialism exist nowhere else but in the hearts and minds of those people in which they are embodied. Nothing good can come from anger. The only transformation possible is destruction.

We must love the world in order to change it. We must rise _up_ and not merely _against_. We are called to build.

Let’s get together and buy some land and build a hall. Design it with intention: open, flexible space. Build some living quarters: humble, efficient, but cozy. Find a way to live here together. Work the soil. Grow crops. Solve problems. Get creative. Rise to the challenge.

Let us first build something true, and then see where it goes.

### Communes and Cults

Humans are meant to live in tribes, so naturally people have tried to make this sort of thing happen many times. How come it usually fails? 

The most common reason, which I think accounts for most hippie communes etc, is lack of commitment. The hippies mostly stayed individuals; their unions were weak because provisional. As discussed, if you are not absolutely committed, external possibilities will continue to exert a gravitational pull. When things get tough, as they certainly will, you bail.

Most intentional communities in the west these days have embraced this limitation, and make little to no effort to separate themselves from civilization at large. They are essentially rental housing. Everyone has a job outside of the community, and they come home from their job and are tired, and maybe there’s a communal dinner and some hanging out. This is better than nothing — it’s good to have people around, so that social interaction is the default pastime. You shouldn’t have to make plans to see your friends. It should be automatic and always available. Like going on your phone. Nobody makes plans to go on their phone. If hanging out with friends is as easy as going on your phone, you won’t be lonely.

So living in a community with a common area where there will usually be some people to hang out with — this is very good. It is community that people need, not the tribe per se, and a setup like this is perfectly sufficient to meet basic belonging needs. But without commitment, there is no liberation from the constant flux of new faces. The others will come and go. You are all still individuals at the end of the day. Even if _you_ are committed to the community, you have no reason to believe the others are on the same page. Perhaps you feel a strong bond with your team of coworkers at the moving company, but almost everyone would like a better job, and will eventually take their chances. Work there for a decade and you will watch the tribe be constantly made and unmade around you like a never-ending ship of Theseus time-lapse. This is typical of uncommitted community. It frays. And you tire of introducing yourself and getting always left behind.

A marriage can only work if both partners are committed. A tribe can only work if everyone is all in. Nomads with commitment issues are not a strong foundation for a new cultural paradigm. What is needed is to give up the dream of the individual entirely, and give oneself away in the spirit of service. But without a tribe which we know will respond in kind, then we are giving ourselves away for nothing in return. Under these conditions it is certainly rational to be an individual. It is a classic prisoner’s dilemma.

Getting a bunch of idealistic individuals together will inevitably fail without deep commitment, but it is also possible to fail in the opposite direction. Some groups are so committed to each other that they shut themselves off from the outside world. This too nullifies the possibility of building a true tribe, because a tribe needs a larger ecosystem to relate to.

Isolation is as toxic for tribes as it is for individuals. Closed systems are prone to stagnation and devolution. With no way for energy to flow in or out, the tribe becomes insular, self-recursive, and strange. Like a paranoid agoraphobe, the commune loses touch with reality and becomes a cult. Everything needs to be in relationship with outside, rather than merely talking to itself.

Our tribes will have the best chance of success if we can cultivate local networks of interconnected communities, knit together by the same threads of goodwill and mutual giving that bind the tribe itself. 

Just as the individual human finds their best flourishing in a tribe, so a tribe will flourish within a web of tribes. The pattern is the same: isolated units are weak; to be is to relate. We are made for this.

### The Fractal Body

A fractal is a thing where the parts are like the whole. As above, so below. The same patterns repeat at all scales.

All highly functional structures organize themselves this way. Trees are the fixed nodes of almost every bioregion. They are fractal. Their trunks diverge into branches, which in turn branch; their roots the same. All trees are connected via a fractal mycelial network which pulsates with the data of the whole. 

The Earth’s water system is fractal, as a map of any river’s tributaries will demonstrate. Countless streams flow downhill, merging and carving valleys, meeting rivers, flowing towards the ocean where each drop is the whole. Water evaporates into clouds with fractal edges. Turbulent eddies are placated, cuddly cumulus clouds get riled up and send down rain and fractal branching lightning. It is impossible to separate any one of these processes from all the others. All flows, all is one interconnected system, and it is fractal.

Our bodies are no different. Our blood vessels branch like the rivers. Our neurons are nodes interconnected in a vast web like the forest. Our cells are autonomous beings fractally organized into larger structures.

On every level, the organic flow of energy, nutrients, and language takes on a fractal character. It is the natural shape of this reality. All evolution tends toward it.

Fractal organization is efficient. It enjoys an inherent dynamism and connectivity. It is resilient, like trees, and adaptable, like water. Systems are not engineered this way from above, in the name of some abstract ideal, as with our political systems and modern architecture. They evolve a fractal shape, taking their cues from the flow of energy within which they are to exist. It’s only natural.

If all creatures and systems evolve towards fractal organization, I posit that the same is true for cultures. All will settle into a fractal model; it is simply optimal. 

In the tribe, the individual feels no separation from the larger body. The individual is the tribe. The one is the all. I identify myself absolutely with my tribe. Like the tree to the forest or the seal to the ocean, I have no existence outside of its context. I am prepared to die for my tribe–but first, I will live for it. There is no separation. The tribe is my body.

I believe that the civilization of the future will be made of tribes rather than individuals. How to prevent these tribes from squabbling over resources and destroying each other? By cultivating a culture where tribes feel absolutely identified with their local network, and each local network feels absolutely identified with the world. The previous century’s dreams of international unity are feasible in principle, but only if they are grounded in local life, local love and flourishing.

The skeleton of the future will be something like a fractal-tribe. 

### Specialization

On every level, the network is strong because of its diversity. In the tribe, my flaws are balanced by another’s gifts, and vice versa. In the fractal tribe, all benefit from the obvious advantages of economic specialization.

Take sheep. Keeping sheep is one way to live. It is a beautiful symbiotic relationship. The sheep are kept safe in exchange for their wool, milk, and meat. Yes, some sheep are killed, but this is only the same natural regulation of the herd’s population that would be performed by predators in the wild. 

If one tribe specializes in keeping sheep, they may provide wool to the whole local network. Everyone benefits from being on good terms with the shepherds.

Suppose one tribe specializes in healing and another specializes in building infrastructure. A skilled builder entering the network or coming of age within it could choose to live with other skilled builders, or to be the building specialist among healers, or weavers, or wisdom keepers — or wherever builders happen to be needed.

The tribe of shepherds may weave sweaters and sell them in the online marketplace. Within the fractal tribe, of course, a gift economy will be practiced; but there are many advantages to trading with civilization. It is unlikely that the fractal tribe will be able to manufacture solar panels or laptops, so sources of revenue will be useful.

Where we must draw the line of specialization is here. Though some tribes may produce more than their share of the collective breadbasket, All Tribes are involved in producing and/or procuring food. All will be able to feed themselves, if it should come to that. Some may have whole fruit forests and vast salad gardens, others may specialize in apples and hunt the occasional deer, channeling the bulk of their energies into art and textile production. Some may keep chickens and grow potatoes, while others maintain walking paths flanked with berries of all kinds.

Trade will ensure that everyone eats a balanced diet. But all tribes will have their own material yields. Thus nobody is allowed to be removed from the business of keeping living. Leaders may not only lead, they must also plant seeds. Artists will harvest physical fruits as well as spiritual ones.

It is good to be involved in feeding yourself. It makes you feel capable. It connects you to the essence of being human.

### Income

Hunter S. Thompson, a true individual, once gave this advice:

> Don’t look for goals. Look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live, and then see what you can do to make a living within that way of life.

This quote has always stuck with me for how beautifully Hunter’s own life bears testament to it. He did not set out to write a bestselling book or become a renowned journalist. He set out to live a life of adventure. He wanted to write and to travel and to be unbound. He was 22 when he wrote the above. And he found the way. You gotta love him.

I’m writing this here pamphlet because I have decided how I want to live. I want to live in a tribe. I want to form a viable orientation to civilization not as an individual or a family, but as a tribe — a community of equals that is bound together no matter what.

I want to live among my tribe and be known. I want to give my love to these people. I want to do honest physical labour. I want to build and farm and hunt and lift heavy things. I want time and space to do my creative work — writing, singing, and so on. I want to gather around the fire in the evening, make music and be merry. I want to make decisions in communal assemblies where everyone can say their piece. I want to be married and raise children, and I want them to grow up surrounded by this love, not alone in their own rooms staring at their screens. I want them to grow up in the tribe where there will always be people of all ages to talk to and play with and learn from. I want us all to realize our potential together.

I’m telling you all this because, naturally, I can’t do it alone.

Consider yourself invited. We will figure out a way to make it happen.

Now, how will the tribe make money? We are not intending to live off the grid separate from civilization and all of its filth and devastation and awesome gadgets — it is our mess, too. We were fed by the grocery store growing up and you are what you eat. We are part and parcel of this story of civilization. Our tribe will have wifi and we will share our art; we will stay in touch. We are ultimately agents of the metamorphosis of the species, and we can’t do this work off the grid. We are not severing ties with civilization, and money is the language of civilization. Therefore, it will behoove the tribe to have some sort of an income.

Not all the tribes in the network will need to make money. It will benefit the network for some to stay sacrosanct, fully immersed in their sacred connection to nature and each other. Such tribes will be the anchor to true reality and the measure of health. This is a beneficial specialization no doubt about it — like the monks and shamans of yore, they aren’t freeloaders, but indispensable mirrors. Trade with civilization is only one of many possible specializations, and even in the tribes which practice it, it will always be secondary to farming and looking after our own. 

### Utopia

Look — it’s not utopia. There will be lots of drama. But through faith and love I believe we will find a way.

It’s not utopia. 

Suppose we build a fractal tribe by the ocean and save enough money for a water desalination plant. Everyone will be drinking ocean water and that’ll be our ace in the hole. Well, the ocean is super polluted. Who knows what it’ll look like in 30 years, if civilization fails to change course. If we are ocean people, and our whole tribal network is hardcore committed to drinking ocean water, what do we do? We could try to pivot, find other water sources, but who’s to say they won’t be just as polluted, or long dried up?

Or we can lean in and get weirder. Accept mercury poisoning as another parameter of the game. What kind of mushroom trips will our teenagers be having as they come of age? What kind of strange ailments will we contract? Our species has made quite a mess of this world, and there’s no escaping the consequences. We’ll roll with it, and do our best, but it’s not gonna be utopia.

We can adapt to anything — the best or the worst. Obviously it’s best to aim for the best. So in that sense this pamphlet is utopian. But the form of the tribe is equally suited to an apocalyptic scenario. Drinking yucky polluted water and getting all weird, and keeping the flame alive in spite of everything. Accepting our conditions. Moving through the world as it is, and loving it no matter what.

Suppose there’s a massive earthquake. We’re due for one, where I live — ‘The Big One,’ we call it. Suppose the big one hits in the dead of winter when it’s dangerously cold outside. Suppose most of our buildings collapse and some of our people die. In a matter of moments we are thrust into a struggle for survival so intense we have to postpone our grief. 

It will happen. Periods of extreme suffering are inevitable for those who cast off the scaffolds of modernity. But bonds are forged and strengthened through collective struggle. 

In his book Tribe, Sebastian Junger writes about how war and natural disasters reawaken our dormant instinct for unity. From earthquakes to the Blitz, catastrophes are perhaps the most potent corrective for almost all forms of social and mental illness. Suicide rates consistently plummet in their wake. We are yet to see a case of Hobbesian chaos breaking loose in a disaster-stricken place. On the contrary, it seems the better angels of our nature which are loosened from the shackles of everyday culture. 

Disasters bring people together. Having our comfort zones obliterated can trigger awakening. You can be sleepily complacent in the city’s obvious horrors under ‘normal circumstances,’ when they’re just part of the furniture. But a major earthquake or hurricane makes clear that this kind of wishful ignorance is untenable. You see clearly that we are all down here together doing our best. You see that that homeless guy is _literally_ your brother, and that his utter dehumanization is, in fact, your business. 

> Communities that have been devastated by natural or man-made disasters…become more just, more egalitarian, and more deliberately fair to individuals…it is a kind of fleeting social utopia.

I believe in the utopia buried in the human heart, which is always available, waiting for its cue. I will happily take this kind of utopia over our plastic paradise of hollow comfort. Make no mistake, consumer society is itself a utopian ideal. Too long has it rested on the laurels of being rational, inevitable, necessary. In fact the idea of endless economic growth is _in principle_ absurd, and always has been. The capitalist believers are all utopians of the greatest naiveté. They spout endless babble about some perfect technology coming along and delivering infinite power and plenty, liberating us from our own mess, if we can only stay the course of sensible reform. Make no mistake — whether we have faith in industrial civilization to innovate itself some kind of renewable energy life raft, or if we think it is broken and disproven and we are capable of better — we are all utopians now. 

Given the choice, I prefer a social utopia to a material one. In the tribe, there will be lots of discomfort and hard work and we will have to bury some of our loved ones — but we will be _living together_. In civilization, providing this strange golden age can hang on for a few more decades, our deaths may be postponed — but we will never truly _live together_. 

As for me, I would sooner die before my time, would sooner bury some of my companions, my brothers and sisters, even my children — than see us all stagnate in mutual isolation.

We all have a choice to make. The jig is very nearly up, and things are gonna get nasty. We all must choose between unpredictable, relational life; and doing what we can to maintain business as usual. 

It’s not utopia. It’s just living as humans, with humans, in the world. You think it’s utopia, but it’s actually the bare minimum.

It’s not utopia. Utopia is boring. It will be an _adventure_!

### Action

We can do it, you guys!

If this vision speaks to you, if it seems worth a shot, you should know that it isn’t just idle theorizing. Myself and others are working towards making it a reality in our own lives. We don’t want to live as individuals. We have figured out that it goes nowhere, that it is unfulfilling in micro and doomed in macro. We want to commit to each other and find some way to live together. And this is within reach. 

Suppose 20 people are committed to building a tribe together, and they can each save $5000 per year. In 10 years, the group will have One Million Dollars, a famous amount of money. That will buy land, remote land with no zoning regulations, and building supplies. We will live in tents while we get the show on the road. It will be incredibly challenging. We will have to endure plenty of discomfort, resolve many a conflict, but there will be lots of love and lots of laughs. We will band together for real.

And this one million number is just an estimate. Perhaps someone will own a business or come from money or own a home or receive an inheritance. And that can bump the fund up by a lot. 

Maybe, if you’re so inclined, you do a decade as a stockbroker or realtor, or some other bullshit derivative game. You’ll have a real motivation, which will give you the necessary strength and endurance to spend a while in the belly of the beast. Or maybe a philanthropist could be convinced to throw some money our way. The tribe solves mental illness and [education](https://medium.com/@lucasflem/education-of-the-future-8e85a444d787), and that’s just for starters.

If we get together and do everything we can, the money will come, one way or another. Trust.

### Synthesis

The stupendous fruits of industrial civilization have a great potential if we can muster the courage and imagination to make use of them.

AI and the internet are part of our destiny. They could not have been invented if we had not gone down this path. But now that they have been invented, and we are on the precipice of a whole new game, we had better figure out what we actually want.

A group of people who know, love, and trust one another will be a very expansive container for new ideas to be shared and discussed. These are think tanks as well as being life rafts. If there are many tribes, all around the world, all discussing the future of civilization, and exchanging ideas with each other via cyberspace, we may hit on some extremely fertile patterns, and refine them far more efficiently than we could alone.

The internet allows us to share our best. Permaculture techniques, conflict resolution strategies, blueprints, recipes, poetry. All the fruits of all of our experiments may benefit the whole sweep of humanity. 

I hold out hope for some grand synthesis between nature and technology — the Gaia mind incarnate in silicon, simple farming communities 

But perhaps we are too far gone, and the only way forward begins with a rude awakening.

Whatever happens, we should meet the future at our best.

It is not a going back. It is a coming full circle. In order to chart our course from a place of love and peace.
