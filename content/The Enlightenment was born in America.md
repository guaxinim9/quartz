  - The Enlightenment was born
---
I learned this from the amazing book, The Dawn of Everything, by Davids Graeber and Wengrow. Enlightenment ideas were born in the fiery confluence of two cultures. 

This really shouldn't surprise us. Great advances often result from a confrontation with the other. The crusades, Alexander's campaigns, and the rise of the Mongols–all catalyzed new flowerings of culture, East fertilizing West and vice versa. The Islamic Golden Age resulted from abundant Arabic engagement with the wisdom of Greek antiquity, and during the crusades the West rediscovered its own lost heritage in the Caliphate's libraries. We always break new ground when given an opportunity to see ourselves through the eyes of the stranger.

Of course, these examples all involved shocking violence on a grand scale, and the meeting of indigenous America and colonial Europe would prove to be no different. However, in certain regions, there was a honeymoon phase, when intellectual exchange prevailed. Before settlement began in earnest, when it was just a few intrepid explorers and missionaries. Columbus just went and massacred a bunch of guys and brought home a bunch of gold–and sure enough, Iberia contributed little to the Enlightenment. France, on the other hand-

The French Jesuit missionaries went to America to convert the natives to [[Christianity]]. It was their sacred duty to learn the language of their hosts to fluency, grok their way of life and model of the universe, in order to convert them to the gospel. Straight off the bat it would seem to be a given that some productive cross-pollination would result from this. A whole cohort of smart, curious, high-openness people, living in the closest communion with people who couldn't be more different from them, and bringing the resultant insights home? How could not both sides be totally transformed by the contact?

Anyway, they went to convince everyone of the truth of Christianity, and it turned out to be a more difficult challenge than they'd bargained for, as the [[The Tribe|tribal]] people did not necessarily agree that they were fallen and filthy and in need of salvation in the first place, as most civilized people begrudgingly do. Also, the tribals were sharp–far from the slack-jawed savages of popular expectation. Jesuits were shocked by their intelligence and rhetorical facility.

> Father Le Jeune, Superior of the Jesuits in Canada in the 1630s: ‘There are almost none of them incapable of conversing or reasoning very well, and in good terms, on matters within their knowledge. The councils, held almost every day in the Villages, and on almost all matters, improve their capacity for talking'...Some Jesuits went further, remarking–not without a trace of frustration–that New World savages seemed rather cleverer overall than the people they were used to dealing with at home (e.g. ‘they nearly all show more intelligence in their business, speeches, courtesies, intercourse, tricks, and subtleties, than do the shrewdest citizens and merchants in France’)...

> Native American political leaders, who in most cases had no means to compel anyone to do anything they had not agreed to do, were famous for their rhetorical powers. Even hardened European generals pursuing genocidal campaigns against indigenous peoples often reported themselves reduced to tears by their powers of eloquence. Still, persuasiveness need not take the form of logical argumentation; it can just as easily involve appeal to sentiment, whipping up passions, deploying poetic metaphors, appealing to myth or proverbial wisdom, employing irony and indirection, humour, insult, or appeals to prophecy or revelation; and the degree to which one privileges any of these has everything to do with the rhetorical tradition to which the speaker belongs, and the presumed dispositions of their audience. It was largely the speakers of Iroquoian languages such as the Wendat, or the five Haudenosaunee nations to their south, who appear to have placed such weight on reasoned debate – even finding it a form of pleasurable entertainment in own right. This fact alone had major historical repercussions. Because it appears to have been exactly this form of debate – rational, sceptical, empirical, conversational in tone – which before long came to be identified with the European Enlightenment as well.

It was just these Wendat, or Huron, who lived in what would later be called New France, and is now Quebec. And it is no coincidence that France became the epicentre of the intellectual flowering that would follow.

Notably, although Wendat women had dominion over large aspects of daily life, they had almost no say in councils. This is a reminder that tribal cultures were not utopian idylls, and many of them were somewhere along the [[development of dominator culture]].

Anyway, it is a large story, that of colonization, and so the Daves zero in on the Wendat's relations with the French, which makes sense, because they were close allies for several decades, so there was plenty of time to talk; and from there, they extra-zero in on this one fellow by the name of Kandiaronk.

Kandiaronk was a great Wendat statesman who was one of the most important players in the region at that time. He was unusually brilliant: all who met him agreed that he was one of the smartest people they'd ever met. And he engaged in extensive dialogue and debate with the French, particularly this guy Lahontan, who was also no slouch. 

Lahontan goes back to France and writes a book of his dialogues with Kandiaronk, whose name is changed to Adario, and arguments embellished a little bit, the gaps of memory filled in, but there is every reason to believe Lahontan did his best to capture the essence of Kandiaronk's critique of European mores–the main ideas of which were shared by most indigenous Americans. They found the Europeans totally grotesque and miserable.
