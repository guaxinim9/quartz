Many are worried about the water and power necessary to run today's [[AI]] language models but are totally unconcerned by all the water and power necessary to keep the lights on and the computers running in the countless offices which patently contribute nothing to society. The reason of course is that they take the latter reality for granted, or if it does bother them it seems far too entrenched to change. This mindset of course is what makes it so entrenched, and one reason I support AI is that it has the potential to reactivate our imagination and sense of collective autonomy. If nothing else, similarly to how during covid everyone realized that there was no reason at all for people working in advertising (for instance) to be physically in the office every day, AI may prompt us to realize that there is no reason for anyone to be working in advertising in the first place (etc), and this alone would make all of the water and power worth it.
