### *To choose the world is to choose the work I am able to do, in collaboration with my brother and sister to make the world better, more free, more just, more liveable, more human. - Thomas Merton*

And more life-affirming Merton:

> In Louisville, at the corner of Fourth and Walnut, in the centre of the shopping district, I was suddenly overwhelmed with the realisation that I loved all those people, that they were mine and I theirs, that we could not be alien to one another even though we were total strangers …
> 
> Not that I question the reality of my vocation, or of my monastic life: but the conception of “separation from the world” that we have in the monastery too easily presents itself as a complete illusion…though “out of the world,” we are in the same world as everybody else, the world of the bomb, the world of race hatred, the world of technology, the world of mass media, big business, [[Revolution]], and all the rest. We take a different attitude to all these things, for we belong to God. Yet so does everybody else belong to God…This sense of liberation from an illusory difference was such a relief and such a joy to me that I almost laughed out loud…
> 
> It is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race, though it is a race dedicated to many absurdities and one which makes many terrible mistakes: yet, with all that, God Himself gloried in becoming a member of the human race…And if only everybody could realise this! But it cannot be explained. There is no way of telling people that they are all walking around shining like the sun.
> 
> This changes nothing in the sense and value of my solitude, for it is in fact the function of solitude to make one realise such things…My solitude, however, is not my own, for I see now how much it belongs to them – and that I have a responsibility for it in their regard, not just in my own. It is because I am one with them that I owe it to them to be alone, and when I am alone, they are not “they” but my own self. There are no strangers!
