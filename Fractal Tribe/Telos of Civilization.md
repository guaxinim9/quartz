Civilization happened for a reason. We left Eden to build these machines. It was a means to an end.

These stupendous technologies of ours have a great potential if we can gather the courage and imagination to really make use of them. 

A synthesis dawns: tribes with wifi. 

The internet allows us to live in tribes and be grounded in place, while also participating in the global social ecosystem. This arguably makes cities obsolete. We can now enjoy all of the advantages of the city — the density of interaction, the interconnectivity, the marketplace of ideas — without its fatal flaw of unsustainability and estrangement from nature. 

So the city and the machine that has grown to serve it may be seen as transitory things, as means to an end rather than an end unto themselves. We built civilization so that these technologies like AI and the internet could come into being. They are an integral part of our destiny as a species. They could not have been invented without the dream of civilization. But now that they have been invented, and we are on the precipice of a whole new game, we had better figure out what we actually want. 

We don’t know what we want to do with these tools. We don’t know what’s worth wanting. So all we end up doing is pleasuring ourselves, layering on distractions.

It is not going back. It is coming full circle. In order to decide what comes next from a place of love and peace, which can only come from community.
