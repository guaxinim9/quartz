Truth is, it’s a rational choice. It is objectively, selfishly, rationally optimal to give up the dream of the individual, and become a person who can give themselves freely to others. But realizing this is only the first step. Quitting smoking or gambling is objectively rational, but it is still difficult. It is a journey fraught with paradox, and many don’t make it to the promised land. Will and faith are necessary. The dream of the individual is extremely addictive, but if we are to save the world, we will need to kick the habit. 

This life is unfit for us. We are made for the tribe, not the market of individuals. We need others. We need their love and affirmation, freely given, and returned in kind. We need their guidance as we grow up, and their care as we grow old.

What is your plan for avoiding the agonizing loneliness of the elderly? Be careful. The house which you worked so hard for can become your prison and personal hell. You can become a stranger to your spouse or your own worst enemy. You can literally become agoraphobic and porn-addicted at 80. The system may continue to feed you, but what systems are providing for your spiritual survival? Is therapy really going to do the trick? What if you didn’t have to pay for a wise confidant?

Emotional, psychological, spiritual security are not accounted for. Stick with the life of the individual, and you will end up sick of yourself, watching the screen, bereft of all meaning, sooner or later. Suit yourself, at the end of the day, but know what you’re signing up for. And this is all assuming the apparatus stands long enough to maintain your physical security for the rest of your lifetime, which is by no means a sure bet.

We are aware that our way of life is unsustainable but this has become a bloodless word, which we are so used to hearing as to tune out its meaning entirely. But it is really a simple word, and as visceral as fate and pain. What unsustainable means is it can't go on.

Unless we change course, [[The Collapse]] is inevitable.

You think you’re playing it safe, but there is no such thing. There is nothing so dangerous as safety. Today’s empty safety sows the seeds of tomorrow’s mortal peril. You don’t even know how to make a fire, let alone a decent hut; all of your eggs are in the supermarket’s basket. What happens when the supermarket has no more eggs? What happens when the hospital has no electricity, drugs, or staff? What happens when you can no longer pay men to break their backs on your behalf, and you have to actually give them something? What do you have to give, besides zeroes and ones?

Individuals often feel that their world is vaguely unreal and they are just floating through getting by. The collapse will do away with this illusion for good. Everything here is unbearably real. Everything that happens is exactly what happens. Your food comes from somewhere. Your waste goes somewhere. God’s books are balanced. Everyone here is going to die, and first they are going to do their best, and the world is very large, and everything that happens really happens, you may be torn limb from limb, you may starve on the streets, you may go crazy, get bent, and die die die. There is no escape; there will be an outcome. Something will become of you.

For now, the systems provide. But the flood looms. It will not be kind to the individual. The apocalypse is ego-death in macro.

Unlike the individual, the tribe will be well poised to meet the collapse head-on, having already made self-sufficiency its business. Human individuals are the most adaptable creatures in the world, but tribes are many orders of magnitude more adaptable.

In all possible futures, those who have done the work of reconnecting with what it means to be human — with land, with God, and with each other — will be in the strongest position. And whatever happens in the future, we know for a fact that something’s gotta give. The world will change. It’s going to be a trip.

It is not merely idealistic but also perfectly pragmatic to commit yourself to the tribe. To put your faith in others.
