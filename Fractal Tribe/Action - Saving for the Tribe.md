We can do it, you guys!

If this vision speaks to you, if it seems worth a shot, you should know that it isn’t just idle theorizing. Myself and others are working towards making it a reality in our own lives. We don’t want to live as individuals in this market. We have figured out that it goes nowhere, that it is unfulfilling in micro and doomed in macro. We want to commit to each other and find some way to live together. And this is within reach. 

Suppose 20 people are committed to building a tribe together, and they can each save $5000 per year. In 10 years, the group will have One Million Dollars, a famous amount of money. That will buy land, remote land with no zoning regulations, and building supplies. We will live in tents while we get the show on the road. It will be incredibly challenging. We will have to endure plenty of discomfort, resolve many a conflict, but there will be lots of love and lots of laughs. We will band together for real.

And this one million number is just an estimate. Possibly one of the 20 people will own a business or come from money or own a home or receive an inheritance. And that can bump the fund up by a lot. 

This is a thing worth doing, building a tribe. Maybe, if you’re so inclined, you do a decade as a stockbroker or realtor, or some other bullshit derivative game. You’ll have a real motivation, which will give you the necessary strength and endurance to live for a time in the belly of the beast. It’s a bit like effective altruism. Speaking of which, maybe one of those guys could be convinced to throw a little change our way! The tribe solves mental illness and [education](https://medium.com/@lucasflem/education-of-the-future-8e85a444d787), and that’s just for starters. It definitely beats throwing billions at the AI doom guys to wring their hands.

If we get together and do everything we can, the money will come, one way or another. Trust.

A group of people who know, love, and trust one another will be a very expansive container for new ideas to be shared and discussed. There are some terrific and terrifying technologies presently looming. Immature individuals with no vital connection to land or to others are poorly positioned to make decisions about the future of the world and the proper use of these technologies. Accordingly, let us organize ourselves back into a tribal model, that we all might take part in a collective process of decision making.

We may now liberate ourselves from progress’ endless churn. We may come full circle, return to real life, take a breather, and decide collectively what kind of world we want to build with all of these spectacular tools.

It is not a going back. It is a coming full circle. In order to chart our course from a place of love and peace.

You’re invited.
