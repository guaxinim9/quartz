A choice must be made in the instant. To choose all of the possibilities is to have none of them. You must choose one. The abstract idea of absolute freedom is just another thing to bind yourself to. Better to bind yourself irrevocably to others. To choose community and love that truly may endure. 

It is thought that freedom and commitment are at odds, but freedom is no more the opposite of commitment than a blank canvas is the opposite of a masterpiece. Your freedom only affirms itself as freedom when it is used to choose a life. To live at all, it is necessary to choose one thing over all of the others, and to get used to this movement, and do it over and over. 

It's one of the hardest things for our generation, having grown up with infinite options.
