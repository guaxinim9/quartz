I bet you know the prisoner's dilemma which is when two co-conspirators are both caught and separately interrogated. Each are offered the same deal: sell out your buddy, and you walk free, so long as your buddy stays silent, and he gets a 3 year sentence. If both stay silent, both serve time - say a year. If both snitch, both serve 2 years. 

(Man, prisons are a really inefficient way to do business. Keeping dangerous people off the streets...but 3 years is no time at all, and they only get more dangerous in there. Well, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. It's just weird to be weighing years in the Unpleasant Building as a kind of negative currency.) 

The tragedy of the prisoner's dilemma is that it is strictly optimal for both players to choose betrayal. Regardless of what your partner chooses, you get a better outcome by snitching. If he snitches and you don't, you get 3 years. If he snitches and so do you, you get 2 years. If he stays silent and so do you, you get 1 year. If he stays silent and you snitch, you get zero years. No matter what, you shave a year off your sentence by snitching.

I submit that community without commitment is a little like this. Everyone wants to give their all to a group of people. Everyone wants to be known and loved and safe. But without commitment, these groups fall apart, and if you fell for these people, and gave yourself to them, then you're in a less advantageous position. 

That is, if you choose to believe that you are beyond the selfishness of the market, and the others don't make the same choice, then you're screwed.

But the situation luckily is unlike the prisoner's dilemma because if the other chooses to commit, then you are not better served by leaving. 

And the prisoner's dilemma doesn't even appropriately model a real interrogation of two partner criminals, because it assumes that each player is a 'rational agent' concerned solely with their own welfare. 

Thank God real life is more interesting than economic models.
