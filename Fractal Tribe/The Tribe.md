To be is to give. To receive is to reify the other’s being. We become ourselves only through the other. 

We long to serve each other — truly serve, not merely sell our labour to strangers. Cooking for strangers is different in kind from cooking for loved ones.

In the tribe, everybody knows everybody. Robin Dunbar has suggested that the human brain has a structural limit on the number of close social relationships which can be maintained. His guess is 150, give or take a hundred. The idea is that our brains are built for communities of about this size. Any larger, and you can’t know everyone. You can know their names, you can know some facts about them, but you can’t truly know who they are and how you all relate to one another. There’s just not enough space in your head. Deep camaraderie with another is complex. Lot of moving parts. 150 people makes 10,000 one-on-one relationships. You gotta fit that whole network in your head. 

Some people seem to have a sort of innate diplomatic archetype, and they can live and move confidently in networks far larger than 150. For example, a high school of 1500. There are always a few social butterflies that seem to know everyone. But then — there’s the rub! — you all graduate, and all of those people that you spent time and energy getting to know are no longer relevant. You may hang on to a few friendships, but most of the data you accumulated will be pretty well useless. Everyone goes their separate ways. 

How many times does this happen, in a lifetime, in civilization? How many times do you learn the rhythms of some social ecosystem — elementary school, high school, university dorm, job, etc — only to leave? How many times do you get to know another person, only to drift apart? And then you’ve gotta introduce yourself to another stranger.

This constant coming and going takes a toll. It’s inefficient. Truly getting to know someone takes a lot of time and energy. Amidst this flux, you may lose your drive to connect altogether. 

Suppose instead you were committed to live, work, and play with the same group of people. For life. Imagine how well you would get to know them! The mutual trust you would build!

Imagine the peace of being surrounded and supported by a group of people who are in it with you, the endeavour of life, who know you in the fullness of your personality and spirit, your quirks and your genius, your flaws which can never become tragic or self-destructive for they are balanced by the love and grace of the whole, and they love you, warts and all, and all, and all. You are loved, you are seen, you are appreciated for what you bring. You can count on your tribe.

And the anxiety of not having this, not in its fullness, of having it in fragments, and always subject to conditions. The individual lives in fear, because the individual is built for the tribe, but has been forced to fend for themselves.

I found myself at Christian church one Sunday and the guy was talking about the notion of being fully known and fully loved by God. He reckons only God can fully know and fully love you. He has never felt it from anywhere else. ‘To be fully known, and fully loved,’ he said, ‘I think that is how I would define the kingdom of Heaven.’ And of course it is the tribe.
