Living things enjoy a unity of purpose. There is no separation between body and mind. Both are instruments of the same. 

Every form evolves to fulfill a function. The tiger pounces, the deer flees, the flea sucks, the spider weaves — all live as seamless extensions of their environment, bound by their relations to each other and the conditions of the incarnation. We are no different. We have a place within the order of things.

The Bantus of Africa have a saying: ‘Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu’ — a person is a person through other people. We are social animals. We are meant to live together, work together, give our all to each other. We are optimized for life in small, committed groups, where everyone knows everyone, and a strong community spirit is the bedrock of all activity. Let us call this the Tribe. 

Just as lions live in prides and bees in hives, humans evolved to live in tribes.

A tribe is a group of humans who live together, who work together, who struggle and flourish together. 

It is like a marriage or family in that the individual’s life is completely bound up with these others.

We belong in the tribe. If modern man is homeless, confused, adrift, with no way of being in the world, we may consider the possibility that this is for lack of a tribe, which is the natural intermediary between the individual human and the overwhelming complexity of things. We are not made to live as individuals. It is very scary for us, and the strategies we adopt to cope are often self-destructive.

Healthy dolphins separated from their pods are known to die of loneliness. Human beings are killing themselves every day. Tribal cultures do not know depression or suicide. Why? Because they live as humans are meant to live. 

Everyone knows that we need community. Everyone knows that we lack community. With the advent of AI and the internet, our civilization has the opportunity to redesign its basic social architecture. This has happened every time a revolutionary new communication technology has come out, from the phonetic alphabet to the printing press. If we rise to the challenge, and allow a new way of life to emerge, there’s no telling what will ensue. If we shrink from it, we can be quite certain that our children will all be strung out on hyper-addictive brain candy, and depressed from social media, sooner rather than later. So it is not only an opportunity to rethink things but a mandate. If we cling to the known, we will watch it rot in our arms, and have no one to blame but ourselves. 

Our evolutionary legacy may hold some inspiration, in this adventure of cultural redesign. We _know_ that human beings are happy in tribes, moving with the rhythm of things. We know that suicide is unheard of and cancer extremely rare, among people living in a human way. How many billions does our society pour into mental health and cancer research? Could the solution be as simple as living with others, and doing real work together?

Let us become as tribes again. Gather our people. Pool our resources. Let us get together for real, commit to each other, and forge a life as one.
