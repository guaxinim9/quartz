Humans evolved to live in [[The Tribe|tribes]], and we are happy in tribes. Herons evolved to hunt at low tide, and they are happy by the seaside.

Now, we are not herons. We are more adaptable by far, and can find flourishing in almost any circumstances–as long as we are with others.

In civilization today, we are with others all the time, but we are not _with_ others. We are not in it together with them, moving through the world as one unified body. We are moving through the world alone; all of our relationships are provisional — for right now. The essence of the archetype of the tribe is commitment to a set group of others. This can take almost any form, as long as everyone in the tribe knows everyone, and nobody is going anywhere. True commitment is a necessary prerequisite for building community.

Commitment is the only antidote to the market’s infinity of choice. It alone unlocks the deepest love this life has to offer. We think that freedom and commitment are opposites, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Freedom is to commitment as a blank canvas is to a masterpiece. The latter is the highest realization of the former. Freedom affirms itself as freedom when it is used to choose — in the instant, for ever. 

Let us briefly discuss marriage. If you truly love another person, you take yourself off the market. You stop searching. You stop yearning. You redirect your focus away from the ingrained habit of restless desire. Depending on your disposition and the extent of your sickness, it may take some time before the infinite possibility of beautiful strangers truly fails to stir you. But it is bound to happen, because you are not built for this flux. 

Likewise once you find your tribe, you must take yourself off the market of possible lives, possible faraway belonging and fulfillment. You must accept the life and the love which God has given you. You must get stuck in! Give your all to your people! Cultivate this garden with all your might! You will find the strength of your will grow as the garden does — whereas alone in the pleasure dome, nothing grows, nothing is truly given or received, and your power will certainly atrophy.

I would like to frame the tribe as community plus commitment. 

The tribe means togetherness, unity of purpose. The tribe means sharing this life. The tribe means cooperation and cohabitation with the same consistent group over the course of a lifetime. Naturally you are bound to evolve together towards an evermore perfect union. But you get none of this if all the other lives you could be living are still on the table. The tribe means being all in.

If you fail to choose decisively, to commit your entire being, if you stay trapped in the game at large, falling in love with strangers and pictures of faraway lands — then what you have will remain merely one of many options. And what you have — your tribe, your wife, your life — will be known and banal, its faults and small dysfunctions constantly present. If you never choose this particular branch of the tree with everything you got, eventually the fantasy of the infinite will overpower your lazy comfort and force of habit, which is no substitute for true commitment.

And what can perfect strangers or exotic idylls really give you? They will become banal in their turn. Meanwhile you will grow old adrift, a trillion figs rotting at your feet.

The infinite is no place to make a life. The individual ages poorly.

Therefore, choose with gusto!
