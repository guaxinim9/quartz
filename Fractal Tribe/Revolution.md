Civilization is unbecoming. We cut down the trees. We fill the ocean with trash. We rape our mother. We make ourselves weak and miserable. Meanwhile we contain ourselves.

It’s old news. I know you know the score. But [[What can we do?]] We could all rise up and destroy the existing order, but we know that goes nowhere. It’s as if some fine print hidden in the laws of physics says we’ll just get an even meaner guy atop an even bigger mess. We could work within the system to gradually reform it, but man, guys have tried, and we know where that one goes, too. You make infinite compromises to even get far enough in the game to stand a chance, and if you keep your focus and hang on to yourself in spite of everything, you just might be able to nudge the needle a couple millimetres over, only for the inevitable reaction to lash things back to how they were, if not further. Again some law of dynamics seems to be at play here. The house always wins.

The house wins because it is the house. By ascending its ladder you accept its logic. You agree to move within it according to its terms. Perhaps if you make it to the top you can fiddle with the levers, but you cannot subvert the fundamental nature of the beast. Plus, on top of everything, things blur together. Your engagement with them must be generalized and abstracted. You must deal in big data and broad trends. You lose sight of the details, and the details are human beings.

Saving humanity cannot be a top-down business. It won’t happen in one fell swoop. This is the individual’s dream of perfect heroism: saving the world as unquestioned and universally acknowledged main character. To be the hero: above all. This angle only affirms civilization, which, after all, is a particular strain of male self-centredness.

So no revolution, and no electoral politics. There is a reason why nobody believes in revolution anymore. It has almost never succeeded in changing things for the better. Playing the game of the system has been a little more successful, but these days it feels totally impossible to get anywhere. WD-40 won’t do for these wheels; what they need is closer to Deus ex machina. Which we can’t count on.

The system cannot be changed from within, and it cannot be destroyed from without, at least not to anyone’s benefit. We must build first.

> You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.— Buckminster Fuller

The 20th century’s revolutionary communist masses rose up in the name of an abstract idea to destroy the old order. It was assumed that building something better would be a relatively trivial task to be worried about later, since everyone meant well and generally had the right idea and intended to do their best.

On taking power in Cambodia the Khmer Rouge declared that it was now ‘Year Zero.’ This meant the total annihilation and forgetting of everything that came before. They cleared out the cities and abolished money. They forced everyone into agrarian communities. They killed everyone who embodied any of the old cultural ideals: all the lawyers, teachers, financiers, writers, doctors, industrialists, engineers, and clergy. Then they fizzled. The regime lasted 4 years. All these utopian ideals, and all they ever did was kill guys! I mean, all these communist revolutions, they came from anger, that was their spiritual impetus, the anger of the male ego, and they focused all of their energy on society’s badness, and they were totally without God or gratitude. And so of course all they ever did was kill guys, since systems like capitalism and imperialism exist nowhere else but in the hearts and minds of those people in which they are embodied. Nothing good can come from anger. The only transformation possible is destruction.

> Communism is not love. It is a hammer which we use to crush the enemy. — Mao

What happens when the enemy is well and truly crushed? The people themselves become a nail.

We must love the world in order to change it. We must rise _up_ and not merely _against_. We are called to build.

Let us become as tribes again. Pool our resources for real. Get our people together. Save money. Buy some land. Build a hall. Design it with intention: open, flexible space. Find a way to live here together. Work the soil. Grow crops. Solve problems. Get creative. Cultivate collective confidence. Rise to the challenge. Experiment. Synthesize. Love.

Let us first build something true, and then see where it goes.
