A fractal is a thing where the parts are like the whole. As above, so below. The same patterns repeat at all scales.

All highly functional structures organize themselves this way. Trees are the fixed nodes of almost every bioregion. They are fractal. Their trunks diverge into branches, which in turn branch; their roots the same. All trees are connected, through their roots, to a fractal mycelial network.

The Earth’s water system is fractal, as a map of any river’s tributaries will demonstrate. Countless streams flow downhill, merging and carving valleys, meeting rivers, flowing towards the ocean where each drop is the whole. Water evaporates into clouds with fractal edges. Turbulent eddies are placated, cuddly cumulus clouds get riled up and send down rain and fractal branching lightning. It is impossible to separate any one of these processes from all the others. All flows, all is one interconnected system, and it is fractal.

Our bodies are no different. Our blood vessels branch like the rivers. Our neurons are nodes interconnected in a vast web like the forest. Our cells are, in some sense, autonomous beings fractally organized into larger structures. Our cells themselves contain intricate fractal networks of proteins.

On every level, the organic flow of energy, nutrients, and language takes on a fractal character. It is the natural shape of this reality. All evolution tends toward it.

Fractal organization is efficient. It enjoys an inherent dynamism and connectivity. It is resilient, like trees, and adaptable, like water. Systems are not engineered this way from above, in the name of some abstract ideal, as with our political systems and modern architecture. They evolve a fractal shape, taking their cues from the flow of energy within which they are to exist. It’s only natural.

If all creatures and systems evolve towards fractal organization, I posit that the same is true for cultures. All will settle into a fractal model; it is simply optimal. 

In the tribe, the individual feels no separation from the larger body. The individual is the tribe. The one is the all. I identify myself absolutely with my tribe. Like the tree to the forest, the seal to the ocean, the spider to the web, I have no existence outside of its context. I am prepared to die for my tribe–but first, I will live for it. There is no separation. The tribe is my body.

The human being in a tribe is absolutely identified with their tribe; they feel no separation. They live to serve the tribe.

I believe that the civilization of the future will be made of tribes rather than individuals. How to prevent these tribes from squabbling over resources and destroying each other? By cultivating a culture where tribes feel absolutely identified with their local network, and each local network feels absolutely identified with the world. The previous century’s dreams of international unity are feasible in principle, but only if they are grounded in local life, local love and flourishing.

The skeleton of the future will be something like a fractal-tribe.
