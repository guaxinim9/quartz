On every level, the network is strong because of its diversity. In the tribe, my flaws are balanced by another’s gifts, and vice versa. In the fractal tribe, all benefit from the obvious advantages of economic specialization.

Take sheep. Keeping sheep is one way to live. It is a beautiful symbiotic relationship. The sheep are kept safe in exchange for their wool, milk, and meat. Yes, some sheep are killed, but this is only the same natural regulation of the herd’s population that would be performed by predators in the wild. 

If one tribe specializes in keeping sheep, they may provide wool to the whole local network. Everyone benefits from being on good terms with the shepherds. 

Suppose one tribe specializes in healing and another specializes in building infrastructure. A skilled builder entering the network or coming of age within it could choose to live with other skilled builders, or to be the building specialist among healers, or weavers, or wisdom keepers–or wherever builders happen to be needed.

Some tribes will deal more with civilization than others. Some tribes will integrate new technologies more than others. 

The tribe of shepherds may weave sweaters and sell them in the online marketplace. Within the fractal tribe, of course, a gift economy will be practiced; but there are many advantages to trading with civilization. It is unlikely that the fractal tribe will be able to manufacture solar panels, so sources of revenue will be useful. Some tribes will deal with civilization more than others.

One can imagine how the sons and daughters of rich people in the cities would be willing to shell out a couple thousand on a tribe-made sweater. It is the height of ethical consumption; the ultimate political fashion statement. Perhaps these young aristocrats don’t have the courage or opportunity to join a tribe as yet, but they can vote with their parents’ money. 

A master builder could choose to live with other builders in the building tribe, working on larger projects as a team, or in the healing tribe, or the computer tribe, or the scribe tribe, or in the tribe that hosts dances and sports games, or wherever they happen to be needed. The idea here is to take what is good about the specialization principle without reducing people’s worlds to repetitive tedium. The niche does in some sense become the world. Niches are efficient, but they need to be larger, or people get sick — a kind of claustrophobia.

Where we must draw the line of specialization is here. Though some tribes may produce more than their share of the collective breadbasket, All Tribes are involved in producing and/or procuring food. All will be able to feed themselves, if it should come to that. Some may have whole fruit forests and vast salad gardens, others may specialize in apples and hunt the occasional deer, channeling the bulk of their energies into art and textile production. Some may keep chickens and grow root vegetables, while others maintain walking paths flanked with berries of all kinds.

Trade will ensure that everyone eats a balanced diet. But All Tribes will have their own material yields. Thus nobody is allowed to be removed from the business of keeping living. Leaders may not only lead, they must also plant seeds. Artists will harvest physical fruits as well as spiritual ones.

It is good to be involved in feeding yourself. It makes you feel capable. It connects you to the essence of being human. Estrangement from the basics is to blame for much of
