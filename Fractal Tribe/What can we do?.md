Living things are either programmed for a function or lovingly shaped for and guided towards a purpose. In either case, it is clear that the human being is meant to live and attain their realization in a Tribe–a small group of others known and loved, each contributing their special set of abilities to the whole’s collective flourishing. 

Let us not dream of going back. There is none. And even if there were, to retreat with our tail between our legs and resign ourselves to the stagnancy of Eden would render the grand experiment of civilization always and forever a scar and an abomination. Yet we can be assured that this development does have a reason behind it, a genuine momentum. Civilization as we know it today can be traced back to nuclei independently sprouting all over the world. We can find the first whispers in the art and society of even the most harmonious tribes. If there had been one patient zero, then it would be possible to deem civilization an accident. But it has been woven from many threads, originating from all corners of the globe and around the same time. So something is happening here and it is true.

Many have suggested that civilized humanity as we know it, ugly and noisy and destructive as it may be, is some kind of a transitory period, a chrysalis, a necessary death out of which something beautiful will emerge.

And at any rate it is in our interest to believe in it, civilization, and make the best of it. 

If you don’t believe in it and want nothing to do with it, you can try to wash your hands, but you will still go to the grocery store. Your inner values will be in disharmony with your outer actions. You will grow full of shit.

Unless you go out on your own, rejecting civilization’s fruits, building a cabin in the woods, hunting and gathering and growing your own food, cutting down trees to keep yourself warm through the winter, living ideally in harmony with the land. But alone. This fantasy is solitary, leaving it all behind, all the bullshit, all the drama, all the exhausting complexity of living with fickle others. Almost none of the people who fantasize about this lifestyle will ever enact it. It takes a very specific kind of individual, an outlier in every sense, extraordinarily tranquil, antisocial, and competent. Usually a man, and usually someone whose relationships with human others have been dysfunctional since day one. To go out on your own is always a last resort. Humans will first try every possible way to connect and live with others. 

Or you can rise up and destroy it from the outside, but then you become just another regime. No good can come from anger.

Yet it is no better to accept uncritically the culture you happened to have been born into, and apply all your love and care to the structures that are already there, because they are completely dysfunctional and inhuman, and are the engine of total planetary crisis. And applying all your love and care to anything is no joke–you become emotionally invested in it.

The intention of this message is not to convince anyone that planetary conditions call for a complete metamorphosis. It is meant for those already convinced, as a suggested direction for their efforts to that effect.

We conclude that the only thing to do is decondition and transform oneself, and find a way to serve our communities. Yet it is tricky in our time to give, not merely trade; and to grow, not merely hone.

Not impossible. We all know masters.
