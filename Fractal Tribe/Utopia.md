Look — it’s not utopia. There will be lots of drama. But through faith and love I believe we will find a way.

It’s not utopia. 

Suppose we build a fractal tribe by the ocean and save enough money for a water desalination plant. The whole fractal tribe will be drinking ocean water and that’ll be our ace in the hole. Well, the ocean is super polluted. Who knows what it’ll look like in 30 years, if civilization fails to change course. If we are ocean people, and our whole tribal network is hardcore committed to drinking ocean water, what do we do? We could try to pivot, find other water sources, but who’s to say they won’t be just as polluted, or, more likely, long dried up?

Or we can lean in and get weirder. Contract strange ailments, a few prophetic visions. Accept mercury poisoning as another parameter of the game. Our species has made quite a mess of this world, and there’s no escaping the consequences. We’ll roll with it, and do our best, but it’s not gonna be utopia.

The point is, we can adapt to anything — the best or the worst. Obviously it’s best to aim for the best. So in that sense this pamphlet is utopian. But the form of the tribe is equally suited to an apocalyptic dystopia. Drinking yucky polluted water and getting all weird, and keeping the flame alive in spite of everything. Accepting our conditions. Moving through the world as it is, and loving it no matter what.

It’s not utopia. Suppose there’s a massive earthquake. We’re due for one, where I live — ‘The Big One,’ we call it. Suppose the big one hits in the dead of winter when it’s dangerously cold outside. Suppose most of our buildings collapse and some of our people die. In a matter of moments we are thrust into a struggle for survival so intense we have to postpone our grief. 

It will happen. Periods of extreme suffering are inevitable for those who cast off the scaffolds of modernity. But bonds are forged and strengthened through collective struggle. 

In his book Tribe, Sebastian Junger writes about how war and natural disasters reawaken our dormant instinct for unity. From earthquakes to the Blitz, catastrophes are perhaps the most potent corrective for almost all forms of social and mental illness. Suicide rates consistently plummet in their wake. We are yet to see a case of Hobbesian chaos breaking loose in a disaster-stricken place. On the contrary, it seems the better angels of our nature which are loosened from the shackles of everyday culture. 

Disasters bring people together. Having our comfort zones obliterated can trigger awakening. You can be sleepily complacent in the city’s obvious horrors under ‘normal circumstances,’ when they’re just part of the furniture. But a major earthquake or hurricane makes clear that this kind of wishful ignorance is untenable. You see clearly that we are all down here together doing our best. You see that that homeless guy is _literally_ your brother, and that his utter dehumanization is, in fact, your business. 

> Communities that have been devastated by natural or man-made disasters…become more just, more egalitarian, and more deliberately fair to individuals…it is a kind of fleeting social utopia.

I believe in the utopia buried in the human heart, which is always available, waiting for its cue. I will happily take this kind of utopia over our plastic paradise of hollow comfort. For make no mistake, this consumer society is itself a utopian ideal. It has rested too long on the laurels of being rational, inevitable, necessary. In fact the idea of endless economic growth is _in principle_ absurd, and always has been. The capitalist believers are all utopians of the greatest naiveté. They spout endless babble about some perfect technology coming along and delivering infinite power and plenty, liberating us from our own mess, if we can only stay the course of sensible reform. Make no mistake — whether we have faith in industrial civilization to innovate itself some kind of renewable energy life raft, or if we think it is broken and disproven and we are capable of better — we are all utopians now. 

We aim for a social utopia, rather than a material one. In the tribe, there will be lots of discomfort and hard work and we will have to bury some of our loved ones. In civilization, providing this strange golden age can hang on for a few more decades, our deaths may be postponed — but we will never truly _live together_. 

As for me, I would sooner die before my time, would sooner bury some of my companions, my brothers and sisters, even my children — than see us all stagnate in mutual isolation.

So I just want to make very clear what we’re getting into here. We all have a choice to make. The jig is very nearly up, and things are gonna get nasty. We all must choose between unpredictable, relational life; and doing what we can to maintain business as usual. 

Make no mistake–building the tribe will be a struggle. It will be a great adventure, a challenge fit for human beings. It will involve discomfort, conflict resolution, hard work, and uncertainty. But the alternative goes nowhere, and sets you up for failure in the event of the inevitable shift.

It’s not utopia. It’s just living as humans, with humans, in the world. You'd think it’s utopia, but it’s actually the bare minimum.

It’s not utopia. Utopia is boring. It will be an _adventure_!
