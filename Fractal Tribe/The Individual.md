Unbound by tradition or responsibility, the individual is free to choose his own path, and tell his own story.

This is how I will define the individual: one who is at the centre of their own story. One would be forgiven for thinking this is the case for all beings, that to be a thing at all is to be a ‘narrative centre of gravity,’ in the late Dennett’s phrase. In fact, a tree’s life story has far more to do with the forest as a whole. All of the major events — fire, rain, drought, storm, loggers — are shared with the larger body. Likewise a tribal human being is likely to tell their life story in terms of the tribe. A hard winter, a great party, a bloody skirmish, a migration across vast and unpredictable terrain. The events that are exclusive to the individual will be few and far between: a spiritual revelation here, a grisly injury there; and even they will be told in relation to the tribe: we are given visions to share with others, to better serve them; when we are sick or wounded, others take care of us. Fortunes good and bad are shared.

In the life of the individual, the self is the only constant. The individual is responsible for himself. His fortunes are his own. His story is about him moving in the world, alone.

Didion said we tell ourselves stories in order to live. This belies the essence of the individual. We tell ourselves stories about ourselves; in this our being consists. 

In the tribe stories are handed down, and shared. We tell each other stories in order to live. Stories are the connective tissue of culture and they are not doing their job in one solitary head. 

Certain modern thinkers have rightly declared this life meaningless, but most have erroneously believed that this is a metaphysical statement, rather than an anthropological one.

It is simply the complaint of the human body: I do not touch the other enough; and of the human mind: I can give nothing of mine. Meaning is a relational thing. The world is made of meaning, but the self-referential individual can have no dialogue with it.

The individual every once in a while is a rock star or CEO, and this sort of person is who we normally think of when we think of the individual. But most of the time the individual is cheap labour and an addict.

If man is built for the tribe, he is weak alone. His body knows it. No matter his station, he never feels safe; atop the highest tower he still senses threat and scarcity. Risk-averse and fearful, his decisions will be irrational.

With a tribe, you can overcome and navigate through anything. With a tribe you are the most powerful and adaptable thing Nature has yet created. With a tribe you are safe. Not invincible, but you are safe. You are safe to be, safe to experiment and express, safe to take risks.

Your body knows that without a tribe, you’re dead meat. A small minority of flamboyant individuals turn their tribeless lives into blazes of glory. But the rest get the memo that, by all rights, they’re dead meat, and act like it.

Fending for yourself in this mess is exhausting and it makes a cornered animal of you. Spending all of your energy on reaction, you are at the whim of your environment, and easily manipulated by malevolent interests. You are no good alone.
