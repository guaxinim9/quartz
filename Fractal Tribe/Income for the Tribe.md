Hunter S. Thompson, a true [[The Individual|individual]], once gave this advice:

> Don’t look for goals. Look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live, and then see what you can do to make a living within that way of life.

This quote has always stuck with me for how beautifully Hunter’s own life bears testament to it. He did not set out to write a bestselling book or become a renowned freak journalist. He set out to live a life of adventure. He wanted to write and to travel and to be unbound. He was 22 when he wrote the above. And he found the way. You gotta love him.

I’m writing this here pamphlet because I have decided how I want to live. I want to live in a tribe. I want to form a viable orientation to civilization not as an individual or a family, but as a tribe — a community of equals that is bound together no matter what.

I want to live among my tribe and be known. I want to give my love to these people. I want to do honest physical labour. I want to build and farm and hunt and lift heavy things. I want time and space to do my creative work — writing, singing, and so on. I want to gather around the fire in the evening, make music and be merry. I want to make decisions in communal assemblies where everyone can say their piece. I want to be married and raise children, and I want them to grow up surrounded by this love, not alone in their own rooms staring at their screens. I want them to grow up in the tribe where there will always be people of all ages to talk to and play with and learn from. I want us all to realize our potential together.

I’m telling you all this because, naturally, I can’t do it alone.

Consider yourself invited. We will figure out a way to make it happen.

Now, how will the tribe make money? We are not intending to live off the grid separate from civilization and all of its filth and devastation and awesome gadgets — it is our mess, too. We were fed by the grocery store growing up and you are what you eat. We are part and parcel of this story of civilization. Our tribe will have wifi and we will share our art; we will stay in touch. We are ultimately agents of the metamorphosis of the species, and we can’t do this work off the grid. We are not severing ties with civilization. 

Money is the language of civilization. Therefore, it will behoove the tribe to have some sort of an income.

I don’t know how the tribe will make a living. I don’t really like that expression. We will make a _living_ by growing our own food. And to make money…well, it could be anything.

I once worked in a soap factory making bath bombs. Everyone there was chill except for the boss family who were weird and distant and weren’t friends with anybody despite being there every day, and who were always watching. The other bad thing was that there were no windows. In spite of these two major issues it was not a bad place to work. The tasks were easy and basically satisfying. The time went by quickly. We listened to music and made chit chat.

The soap factory ran out of a converted old auto body shop. Their costs were very low and their margins ridiculous. If this facility had been owned and managed tribally, it wouldn’t have been a half bad way to spend one’s days! Not every day — supposing the tribe had a soap factory, everyone would certainly take turns. Factory labour is very easy and anyone can learn to do it in a couple weeks. As a collective endeavour it would be no less profitable and much more enjoyable, and therefore, all told, more efficient.

Not all the tribes in the network will need to make money. It will benefit the network for some to stay sacrosanct, fully immersed in their sacred connection to nature and each other. Such tribes will be the anchor to true reality and the measure of health. This is a beneficial specialization no doubt about it — like the monks and shamans of old, they aren’t freeloaders, but indispensable mirrors. Trade with civilization is only one of many possible specializations, and even in the tribes which practice it, it will always be secondary to farming and looking after our own. But, it will be useful to buy power tools and solar panels and so on, making good use of civilization’s gadgets being the thing’s whole telos.

Well, it could be a soap factory, or it could be skilled labour — selling really high-quality sweaters made with love at exorbitant prices. The height of ethical consumption for your virtue-signalling city scion. Or it could be creative expression. Internet people make a living from patreon. And it would only take one JK Rowling for all the solar panels and water desalination devices a whole local network could ever need!
