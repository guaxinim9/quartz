> We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community. — Dorothy Day

The US Surgeon General has issued an advisory warning of the dangers of loneliness and extolling the benefits of community. According to the good doctor, social isolation is more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, more dangerous still than alcoholism, obesity, inactivity, and pollution.

Between 2003 and 2020, in the United States, time spent with friends declined an average of 20 hours a month, deep companionship declined 14 hours a month, household family engagement declined 5 hours a month. ‘Social isolation’ increased 24 hours a month. This was all before Covid — wanna bet if it’s worsened? In 2018, only 16% of Americans said that they felt very attached to their local community.

The Surgeon General calls us to action. Let’s get together, guys! ‘Each of us can start now, in our own lives, by strengthening our connections and relationships.’

This is all well and good, and kudos to the doc for taking a stand. But if humans have a fundamental need to belong and connect, it is strange that we should need a public health official to talk us into it. We are social animals. We need each other. In the cities, there are millions of people, all of whom are built to connect. So what gives? Why is there no community?

There must be something in the woodwork. We all need each other; we all seek each other. If we are disconnected, it cannot be for lack of trying — of necessity. A man dying of thirst cannot simply be told to drink. If he had water, he would have already drank it. If he were by a stream, he would not be dying of thirst. Of logical necessity, there must be something deeper separating us than mere laziness. There must be something in the very architecture of our culture. I submit that this something is none other than the form of the individual, his particular way of being — which has shaped the physical architecture of our towns and cities.

Civilization as we know it is made of individuals moving in the world. Our institutions create an artificial coherence. But life is a fractal thing, as above so below, and it is the individual and the life of the individual and the psyche of the individual that gives our civilization its particular character.

And through bitter experience we have found that the individual turns everything he touches into a reflection of himself. His relationships and his beliefs are all provisional, and crumble in time. His community and his God ultimately come second, and are deemed obsolete. Their deaths are televised passionlessly, fanfare having long met the same fate.

And now the individual is lonely, sick to death of getting his.

We are so used to the mode of the individual that we assume it in all of our economic models. The reason why ‘progress’ has hit such a bottleneck is that we cannot imagine an economic system with anything other than individuals as its building blocks. And this is precisely the threshold which we must cross.
